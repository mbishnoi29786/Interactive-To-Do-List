# Interactive To-Do List

## Overview

Welcome to the **Interactive To-Do List** project! This project is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently through a user-friendly interface. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and aims to provide a seamless experience with features like task addition, deletion, completion tracking, and more.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can easily add new tasks to the list. The input is validated to ensure that task names are between 3 and 50 characters long.
- **Delete Tasks:** Each task comes with a close button, allowing users to delete tasks effortlessly.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can click on a task to mark it as completed, with a visual strike-through indicating the completion.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.

## Upcoming Features (Work in Progress)

I plan to enhance the Interactive To-Do List by implementing the following features:

- **Filter Tasks:** Users will be able to filter and see all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.
- **Search Tasks:** Users will be able to quickly find tasks by typing part of the task's name.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks will be saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they persist even after a page refresh.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users will be able to edit tasks directly within the list.
- **Task Priority:** A feature to assign priority levels to tasks and sort the list based on priority.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Users will be able to reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Multiple Lists:** Support for multiple to-do lists that can be managed independently.
- **Due Dates:** Add a due date feature with reminders for upcoming tasks.
